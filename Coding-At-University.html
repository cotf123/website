                        <p>
                            In the twenty-first century, coding is considered as the literacy of today with people learning how
                            to code around the globe. Beginning your coding journey may seem like a 
                            daunting endeavour but what better way to learn than at university! 
                            Code of the Future founder, Ellie Sleightholm, had the opportunity to 
                            talk to Victoria Howarth, a third-year mathematics student, about coding
                            at university and why others should learn how to code.
                        </p>
                                <p class="italics">
                                    What kind of coding were you exposed to throughout your degree?
                                </p>
                        <p>
                            Coding has been an element of my degree right from the beginning. In first year, it was 
                            mainly self-led, with bi-weekly workshops for some guidance along the way. 
                            Core maths modules incorporated python and R-studio was used in statistics. 
                            In second year, I did a module ‘computational mathematics’ which focused 
                            solely on Python - beginning with the basics and building up from there. 
                            I’m now going into third year and there are modules on offer that have a 
                            computational element as well as ‘discovery’ modules from the school of 
                            computer science itself. LaTeX is another programme I have gained familiarity
                            with having used it for typesetting pieces of coursework.
                        </p>
                            <p class="italics">
                                Would you say coding at University has helped you gained skills that are applicable to the workplace?
                                If so, what skills have you gained. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Definitely! Coding and programming are all around us and they are only going to get more common. 
                                And coding is not the only skill that you gain.  You also learn how to think - programming 
                                languages are very specific and even the tiniest changes can make a huge difference so you
                                really have to make sure your thinking is aligned. This is a skill that will be really useful
                                in the workplace.
                            </p>

                            <p class="italics">
                               Would you encourage students to learn how to code? If so, why?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Absolutely, it’s definitely worth giving it a go. You might love it and there are so many 
                                career opportunities if you do, or just do it for fun. As mentioned, the skills you gain go
                                beyond the initial coding. And if you don’t enjoy it, that’s also okay - at least you’ve given it a try! 
                            </p>
