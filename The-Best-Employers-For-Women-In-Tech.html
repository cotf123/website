                            The technology industry is renowned for its heavy presence of male workers with just 17% of the digital 
                            workforce being women. In the 21st century, women are fighting for top tech roles and proving that they
                             deserve a place in this male dominated sector. It can seem daunting and unnerving to picture how or if you 
                             can progress within the technology department of a company. For this reason, Code of the Future founder,
                              Ellie Sleightholm, has explored companies striving to support and hire women in tech.

                        <p>
                            We kickstart the list with Sky, Europe’s leading broadcasting and telecommunications company, who ranked number 
                            1 on The Inclusive Top 50 UK Employers List 2019/2020. Sky are constantly striving to support women in technology 
                            by offering a whole range of programmes within their company. In September 2017, they released their ‘Women in 
                            Technology Scholars’ where they provided funding to accelerate a business idea to harness technology innovation. 
                            On top of this they offer programmes such as ‘Get into Tech’, ‘Women in Tech Insight Weeks’ and ‘Inclusion Weeks’.

                            Ellie Sleightholm, founder of Code of the Future, had the opportunity to spend a week on the ‘Women in Tech’ 
                            Insight Week in between her university studies. She captures her enthusiasm towards the programme in an informative
